# Functional Programming

## Research

### Orienteren

We hebben een API van de OBA gekregen en hebben eerst gekeken wat leuke en goede uitgangspunten zijn voor een onderzoek.
Eerst kreeg ik de API niet aan de praat, maar uiteindelijk met de oba-api van [Rijk van Zanten](https://github.com/rijkvanzanten/node-oba-api) is het geluk om data te kunnen zien.  
Daarna heeft Dennis samen met Folkert-Jan een andere API gemaakt, deze was makkelijker te gebruiken dan die van Rijk naar mijn mening.  


__*Research questions*__
1. Which genre has become more popular after the year 2000?
2. Has the amount of e-books decreased or increased throughout the years?
3. How many Pixar items are there and how many Disney items?
4. Has the amount of books with black & white illustrations decreased or increased throughout the years?
5. __What is the difference in the amount of films & books Disney, Pixar & Dreamworks brought out starting from the year 2000?__

__*Sub-questions*__
 * Did they release more or less movies in the last five years?
 * Are there more women or men who write the movies?
 * How is the ratio between male and female writers different from the earlier years?

__*Variables*__
  * Publishers;
  * Publication year;
  * Writers;
  * Titles of the movies;
  * Number of movies;

  __*Hypothesis*__  
  In de loop der jaren worden er minder films door de 3 grote namen uitgebracht, maar Disney maakt van de 3 nog wel de meeste films.

## Process

### Week 1
#### Day 1 | October 29, 2018
* The kick-off of the course functional programming.;
* Introduction assigment from Mark from the OBA;
* Connect with the API of the OBA;
* Workshop Titus.

Today was the kick-off of the course functional programming. I could not find the room where we had to be for the kick-off, so I ran little bit late. But I did not miss much.  
Someone from the OBA, Mark, came to tell what our assignment was. I could barely hear him, because he was not talking loud enough. Luckily the teachers did tell again what the assignment was.

Mark shared a document with us via slack. With this document we could get a connection with the API of the OBA.

We made the API work with a oba-api of [Rijk van Zanten](https://github.com/rijkvanzanten/node-oba-api) so we could see what kind of data the API of the OBA has.

#### Day 2 | October 30, 2018
* No location to sit with everybody;
* Sat in Theo Thijssen Huis;
* Came up with five research questions.

Today we worked with some students at Theo Thijssenhuis. We had to come up with five research questions based on the data we had.  
It took me a while to come up with five questions, because I could not read the data clearly. Once I took a better look at it I understood the data better and came up with five questions.

__*Research questions*__
1. Which genre has become more populair after the year 2000?
2. Has the amount of e-books decreased or increased throughout the years?
3. How many Pixar items are there and how many Disney items?
4. Has the amount of books with black & white illustrations decreased or increased throughout the years?
5. __What is the difference in the amount of films & books Disney, Pixar & Dreamworks brought out starting from the year 2000?__

#### Day 3 | October 31, 2018

* Changed my research questions to open questions;
* Chose a research question;
* Thought of sub-questions;
* Which data do need to get an answer to my questions;
* Used the code of Dennis and Folker-Jan to be able to search through the API;
* Researched how to search through the API.

All the questions I came up with, you could only answer with yes or no. So I changed them to open questions. Eventually I chose a question I want to do my research about. I am interested in how many disney, pixar and dreamworks movies there are in the OBA from the year 2010.

I also made up some sub-questions. With these questions I can get an answer on my research question and maybe expand my research to make it more interesting.

__*Sub-questions*__
 * Did they release more or less movies in the last five years?
 * Are there more women or men who write the movies?
 * How is the ratio between male and female writers different from the earlier years?

The data that I need:  
__*Variables*__
  * Publishers;
  * Publication year;
  * Writers;
  * Titles of the movies;
  * Number of movies;

And to day we used the API Dennis and Folkter-Jan made. Thea API of Rijk did not work that well with filters, but the other API did.


#### Day 4 | November 1st, 2018

* Found out how to filter with more facets;
* Hypothesis;
* Get results to the research question and sub-questions;
* I made a list of the results for myself for clarity.

Everybody was helping each other with getting the results they needed.
I think it was a very productive day.
I understand how to search through the API.

Today we found out how we can filter on more facets. Now we can get the title, publication year and authors for example. This is handy for when you don't need all the data the api provides.

I also made an hypothesis. This is what I expect to come out of the research I am doing.

__*Hypothesis*__  
In de loop der jaren worden er minder films door de 3 grote namen uitgebracht, maar Disney maakt van de 3 nog wel de meeste films.

The data that I got out of the search I did through the data, I noted in a file. I did this to get the data straight for myself.

#### Day 5 | November 2, 2018

* research afmaken;
* readme aanvullen;
* gastspreker Bert Spaan Observable & d3;
* Specifieke data in terminal te zien krijgen!

Today I tried to finish my research. I searched for a lot of different things to get answers to my questions. I got a lot of results and I could get an anwser to most of the questions.

My hypothesis was right, but I did not get the results I thought I should get. I thought Disney would have made less movies throughout the years, but it would be more than the result I got.

### Week 2
#### Day 6 | November 5, 2018

* gastcollege Rejo van bits of freedom;
* d3 introductie;
* d3 uitgeprobeerd, geprobeerd te snappen;
* tutorials gemaakt met d3.
* schetsen

Today there was a guest speaker from Bits of Freedom, Rejo. He was very easy to listen to. He talked about privacy and how we have the choice ourselves to chose for privacy. It was very interesting.

We also had a workshop about D3.js from Titus. It looked a lot like math and I thought I understood it pretty well when he explained it. But when I tried to understand an example with the code, I figured out it was a lot harder than I thought.  
This is why I did some tutorials so I can understand how D3.js works.

I also made sketches of how I want my results to look like today. You can see them under [Sketches](#sketches).

#### Day 7 | November 6, 2018

* meerdere resultaten
* resultaten zien voor disney, pixar en dreamworks
* d3 tutorial gemaakt
* api deed het niet meer

Today I tried to get more than 20 results with the help of Jessie. We figured this out. But then I had to get the results with 3 searchterms, but you can't put three searchterms in 'q'. But I figured out myself how to do that. So now I get the results for 'disney', 'pixar' and 'dreamworks'.

While we were working, the API stopped working. We could not get results anymore and nobody knew why because it was very sudden. And the teachers were not present.

Because the API was not working I made another D3.js tutorial to understand it better.
