# Functional Programming

## Assignment

Make a data visualization based on the research you have done with the API from the OBA.

## Research

### Orient

We've got an API from the OBA and with help of the oba-api of [Rijk van Zanten](https://github.com/rijkvanzanten/node-oba-api) we could take a look at the data in the API.
I found interesting data to do my research about: Disney, Pixar and Dreamworks.
After that Dennis and Folkert-Jan made another API that was easy to use and with that API we could also parse the data to JSON, just like with the API of Rijk van Zanten.

Eventually I am using the API of Rijk van Zanten again, but with the help of Wouter and his code I can get more than 20 results.

With my research I want to see how much Disney, Pixar and Dreamworks movies the OBA has in their system throughout the years.


__*Research questions*__
1. Which genre has become more popular after the year 2000?
2. Has the amount of e-books decreased or increased throughout the years?
3. How many Pixar items are there and how many Disney items?
4. Has the amount of books with black & white illustrations decreased or increased throughout the years?
5. __What is the difference in the amount of films & books Disney, Pixar & Dreamworks brought out starting from the year 2000?__

__*Sub-questions*__
 * Did they release more or less movies in the last five years?
 * Are there more women or men who write the movies?
 * How is the ratio between male and female writers different from the earlier years?

__*Variables*__
  * Publishers;
  * Publication year;
  * Writers;
  * Titles of the movies;
  * Number of movies;

#### __*Hypothesis*__  
  Throughout the years there are less movies in the system of the OBA from Disney, Pixar and Dreamworks, but there are still more Disney movies in the systems.

## Sketches

## What did I learn?

* What is functional programming: Functional programming (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects.([source: Median](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0))
* How an API works;
* How working with so many students on the same thing can help so much with understanding the code and what you are doing. There are so many students who have more experience with code than I do;
* How I feel that sometimes the school and teachers expect that we have so much more knowledge about code than some of us actually do. The pace is very high for me, that is something I found out.
* How D3 is a lot of math;





HOE KAN MIJN ONDERZOEK VERDER GAAN?
Hoe veel films heeft de oba in het systeem in vergelijking met het aantal dat er is uitgekomen per grote uitgever?
